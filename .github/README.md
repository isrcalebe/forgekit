**GameKit** is a collection of templates for [.NET](https://dot.net) and game development, providing solid boilerplate with a clean project structure.

# Objectives

This template collection is designed to go beyond the typical expectations of a game framework. It provides essential features like basic game initialization, logging, asset management, and unit test support out-of-the-box.

Projects are available as starting points for the following frameworks:

- [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework): [`GameKit.Templates.OsuFramework`](../source/templates/osu-framework)
- [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA): [`GameKit.Templates.FNA`](../source/templates/fna/)

> Each template collection includes a dedicated README with additional details.

# Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher runtime installed.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intellisense and syntax highlighting such as [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) and [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) plugin installed.
